# floodCare

floodCare is an application primarily targetted for people who reside in the San Joaquin county, an area that is particularly vulnerable to floods. The app serves as a middle-man to let those that are suspecting a flood in their area to have all the resources they need in the tap of a button in an app that is as easy and as accessible as possible. It also tracks your location using Google Maps's API to match your location to a flood map website to track nearby floods and damaged levees in your area.
